#### Quickstart Python

This is a new attempt to write a quick introduction to Python (Python 3).  Current content includes three basic intro chapters.

- [intro 1](chapters/intro1.md)
- [intro 2](chapters/intro2.md)
- [intro 3](chapters/intro3.md)

There are several other math-related chapters.  One shows how to calculate the square root of 2.  We do this by successive approximation.  (Actually, this approach can be adapted to any function that returns an irrational number).

Next is a much better way to calculate the square root of 2.

The third is to calculate the logarithm of a number to a given base, here, the base is 2.

- [successive approximation](chapters/sqrt.md)
- [square root of 2](sqrt2.md)
- [logarithm](chapters/log.md)

These are other chapters on sorting, on the popular word game, Wordle and exercising the Genetic Code.

- [sorting](chapters/sorting.md)
- [wordle](chapters/wordle.md)
- [genetic code](chapters/gc.md)

I also have a discussion of Caesar ciphers, the math for public key crypto (original version based on Euler's totient function), and a demonstration of proof-of-work as it's used in Bitcoin.

- [ciphers](chapters/caesar.md)
- [public key math](chapters/math.md)
- [proof-of-work](chapters/proof.md)

Finally, there is an example of code using Matplotlib to demonstrate trials of a 1D random walk. 

- [walk](code/walk.py)

The output:
